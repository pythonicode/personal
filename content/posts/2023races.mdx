Hey there! As I'm slowly recovering from a rough year of injury,
I am coming up with a race schedule for next year to hold myself accountable and
provide a way for myself to get back into sport slowly and safely.

The schedule is tentative and subject to change, nonetheless here it is!

## Anza Borrego Desert Festival | Jan 14-15, 2023

- [Race Info](https://www.attackpoint.org/eventdetail.jsp/event_54477)
- Priority: **Medium**

I will be attending, but mostly for fun and to judge my shape as the injury progresses. Not intending to
race too hard.

## Cal All Comers | Jan 29, 2023

- [Race Info](https://calbears.com/sports/track-and-field/schedule/2022)
- Priority: **Low**

I'll probably either attend this one or the next one depending on how I feel and how it fits into my schedule.
But it would be nice to get a track race in at some point, potentially a 3000m.

## Cal All Comers 2 | Feb 19, 2023

- [Race Info](https://calbears.com/sports/track-and-field/schedule/2022)
- Priority: **Low**

Either this one or the previous one (most likely this one) just judging based on fitness and schedule.

## Dish Run | February 26, 2023

- [Race Info](https://web.stanford.edu/group/runningclub/dish.html)
- Priority: **Low**

Not sure whether I'll compete, but it's on my radar. Whether I'll be able to handle that much downhill on pavement is definitely
up in the air.

## Stanford Treeathlon | March 5, 2023

- [Race Info](http://www.stanfordtreeathlon.com/)
- Priority: **Medium**

I've been doing a decent amount of cross training as a result of my injury and I'm interested in trying out my skills in a triathlon.
Mostly just planning to do this for fun and try to get some of my friends to join me.

## Flying Pig XXV | Mar 24-26, 2023

- [Race Info](https://www.attackpoint.org/eventdetail.jsp/event_49630)
- Priority: **High**

I will definitely be attending and if this ends up being the team trials then I want to compete at a decently high level.
Although I'll mainly be using this as a way to judge how I'm recovering.

## NIRCA Track & Field Nationals | April, 2023

- [Race Info](https://clubrunning.org/races/race_info.php?race=957)
- Priority: **Medium**

Not really going to be focusing on Track and Field this season, but if I'm in decent shape I'd love to
attend Nationals since it's really fun to go with the team. I'm just going to have to make sure to run
at least 1 track race before this.

## West Point NRE | Apr 15-16, 2023

- [Race Info](https://www.attackpoint.org/eventdetail.jsp/event_53718)
- Priority: **Medium**

Depends on whether this is team trials or not.

## WOC Switzerland 2023 | July 11-16 2023

- [Race Info](https://woc2023.ch/)
- Priority: **High**

Not sure in what kind of shape I will be in. Probably not very good, but I would still enjoy running
some races either way. Depends on what sort of plans I'll have this summer.

## North American Championships | July 17-24 2023

- [Race Info](https://woc2023.ch/)
- Priority: **High**

This will be tough being back to back with WOC, but hopefully I'll be in good enough shape to perform well
at both. Most likely I'll just avoid doing the Long Distance at WOC and it will be fine.

More to come!
