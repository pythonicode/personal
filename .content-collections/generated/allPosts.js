    "content": "This years North American Orienteering Championships (NAOC) 2023 was hosted by the Bay Area Orienteering Club (BAOC) in Lake Tahoe, CA.\n\nThese races were my primary goal for the year as I came off a pretty terrible 2022 season skipping the World University Championship races in Switzerland.\n\n![Clint](/images/posts/naoc2023/clint.jpg)\n\n# Recap\n\nThis was an extremely frustrating weekend of racing for me and really made me rethink how I'm approaching the sport of orienteering. Realistically, coming into these races I was probably the least prepared of all the competitive elite athletes in the field which is why, in hindsight, I'm not too surprised by the results. In the moment thought it was difficult to cope with such terrible performance both physically and technically.\n\n### Sprint\n\nThe sprint was definitely my worst race and that was not totally unexpected. I've faired well in sprints before, but typically that's when the navigation is straightforward and I just have been in good shape and executed well.\n\nErin Schirm set the courses at Northstar Resort and I must say that I was extremely suprised by the technicality he managed to achieve for a North American sprint.\n\nI was completely unprepared for the number of fast decisions that were needed to be made, and also was not ready to read the artificial barriers on the map which I struggled to fully comprehend.\n\nMany controls I would plan a route and get stuck behind a barrier that I did not see on the route. I also found myself without a plan coming into a checkpoint which forced me to slow down my pace, yet I'd still fail to choose a good route.\n\nMidway through the course I also got hyper focused on the barriers and missed major route choices through the buildings (a common mistake made by some others as well).\n\nThen once I finished I figured that some other people must have struggled nearly as much as I did, however I came in 11th place, extremely far back from the leaders. Then, after subtracting the large number of errors I realized I would still be far behind which did not offer much confidence in my physical abilities for the upcoming races.\n\n### Middle\n\nOnce again, I don't think I was well prepared for the extreme technicality of this race. The course was set in a different part of Little Truckee Summit when compared to last year's course which I found technically much more straightforward.\n\nI had good speed in the beginning with a strong start toward the second control, however quickly ended up losing contact with the map and failed to recognize that I was doing so. I ended up too low and too short from the control, thankfully I hit control 6 and managed to relocate from there without losing much time.\n\nHowever, screwing up the second control really affected my mentality the rest of the course -- I felt like I needed to push more aggressively to make up time which just ended up with more and more errors including a disasterous 4 minute mistake on control 7 where Danny caught me and I totally botched my compass bearing.\n\nThe ending of the course went decently well. I managed to gain a decent amount of time on Danny and almost regained the entire 4 minute interval in which he gained on me. However at the end of the day I placed 11th again, behind the same group of competitive elites.\n\nAfterwards I wasn't as surprised by this result as compared to the sprint, I knew I had a pretty terrible race and that I could've done much better. The Americans overall faired pretty poorly in this race with Canada sweeping the podium.\n\nI ended the course with pretty bad blisters on my heel which would affect my result in the Long and cause a terrible ending to the already disaster of a weekend.\n\nIf I took anything away from the Middle it was that I was totally unprepared for any kind of technical orienteering. At Westpoint a few months previously I performed decently well because it's terrain that I'm comfortable with: detailed contours and rock features which make it easy to maintain map contact. At Tahoe, the terrain was extremely vague hillsides with few rocks features that were hard to differentiate. I severely lacked any training in this area for a long time and would have needed more practice in this type of terrain if I had any hopes of being able to take the aggressive orienteering posture that I was aiming for.\n\n### Long\n\nI said the sprint was my worst race, but I think the long actually takes the cake here.\n\nAfter the middle I knew that I had to focus more on avoiding mistakes and prioritizing accurate navigation. Yet, I blew over 4 minutes on the first two checkpoints of the course. Once again, this set off a pretty negative mentality especially after the two previous races, however I felt like I managed to reel it in after a couple of clean controls after that.\n\nDespite my positive outlook on the remainder of the course, my speed was not super high and my navigation was still extremely sloppy with small mistakes made on control 5 and 7.\n\nWhen I reached control 8, there was a pain developing in my IT band as I've been dealing with a bout of ITBS over the course of the last month or so. At the same time I was dealing with quite a bit of pain from yesterday's blisters which were just getting worse after each control.\n\nThen, as the symptoms got worse I decided to quit right after reaching control 9. I really don't like the idea of quitting, but certainly made the right decision given the circumstances. I had to walk back 6 kilometers in barefeet just to manage the pain from the blisters. This caused seriously bruising and bleeding of my feet which would once again affect the following days.\n\n### Relay\n\nI did not compete due to blisters which I decided needed to fully heal. I tried a variety of solutions to deal with the blisters like compeet bandages, athletic tape etc. but it just happend to be that the shoes I was running in were far too prone to developing heel blisters that I couldn't really race.\n\nIn hindsight, if I had run in my sneakers instead of my orienteering shoes I could probably have completed the course, but I still think I made the right decision to let the blisters heal an extra day so I was able to run the races later in the week.\n\n![Reflection](/images/posts/naoc2023/reflection.jpg)\n\n# Reflection\n\nThat was absolutely terrible and frustrating, but I also realized that I could channel the frustration to allow myself to rethink my priorities when it comes to orienteering.\n\nLike I already mentioned, I was the least prepared competitive athlete in my category this year. So the fact that I performed the worst out of everybody is not so much a surprise, in fact I should've been more surprised if I had performed well compared to everyone else.\n\nThe Canadian Team had a training weekend beforehand which allowed them to prepare for the terrain and adapt to altitude. Many of the American orienteers had already competed previously during the summer at WOC or otherwise had done a number of orienteering events or specific preparations. Meanwhile I was struggling with ITBS and not doing any orienteering training besides a single day in Tahoe.\n\nI realized that if I want to achieve my goals of becoming a much stronger orienteer and be competitive in the international scene that I need to reevaluate how I'm able to prepare and train for such a possibility.\n\nStudying at Stanford is an amazing opportunity for my future and also just has been a blessing in terms of the friend and connections I've made there. However, it is the worst possible place to be in terms of quality orienteering training and preparing myself for competitions.\n\nAlthough I've \"graduated\" this year, I'm officially done with my degree next Spring. I've considered for a long time the idea of moving abroad for a couple of years to a country like Sweden or England and joining a local orienteering club. I'm still considering this option, although what I've found is that to live in a European country without a job or university sponsorship is impossible. Thus, I've been applying to a number of jobs with the knowledge that getting an entry-level position at a foreign company straight out of college is extremely difficult.\n\nAnother options that I'm seriously considering is moving to Scranton after college. Greg Ahlswede has been set up there for a long time and has mapped many local areas within driving distance that are relevant to technical orienteering terrain. Also, being situated in the Northeast there are plenty more national meets and local meets that are of high quality than in the Bay Area.\n\nAlso, having multiple orienteers (Greg and I, but possible more) in the same area would allow for something that I think Greg has been missing in his training out in Scranton -- the ability to work together to have more optimal sessions. Whether that means just reviewing courses together afterwards, or even pushing each other in mass start and interval trainings to really build up the speed and confidence with orienteering.\n\nThe job market in Scranton is tough and I've been looking for remote entry-level software positions such that I can work from Scranton at a company that compensates fairly well. So that's another options I'm considering.\n\nEither way, I realize that after college I want to prioritize putting myself in a position where I can train and race orienteering much more than I am now that I'm in school.",

    "content": "Patellar tendinopathy (often called patellar tendinitis) is a common overuse injury, caused by repeated stress on the patellar tendon located in front and below the kneecap.\n\nWhat first seems like a mild discomfort in the knee can quickly turn into a destructive chronic condition.\n30% of athletes with Patellar Tendinopathy take more than 6 months to return to sport and many professional athletes retire due to this condition.\n\nIn this post, I want to discuss my experience with Patellar Tendinopathy.\nIt's been quite a confusing time for me, as I've been struggling with this injury for almost a year now.\nI've been to many doctors and tried many different treatments, but the injury is still not fully resolved.\nI want to learn more about this injury and come up with strategies moving forward that can help me to resolve it for good.\n\n# Diagnosis\n\nIt took me a while to get a proper diagnosis for my knee pain.\nThe first doctor I visited thought that it might be shin splints, but having experienced shin splints before I had my doubts.\nI visited another doctor who thought it may be a stress fracture, I performed an MRI and there was no bone damage.\nFinally after 3 months of pain, a doctor landed on patellar tendinopathy as the diagnosis.\n\nWhy did it take so long to get a proper diagnosis? I think that one reason is something called the availability heuristic.\nWhen doctors see a runner with an injury in the lower leg they immediately jump to the most common injuries: shin splints and stress fractures.\n\nPatellar Tendinopathy is an uncommon injury, especially among runners, so it's not the first thing that comes to mind.\n\nEven after being diagonosed with patellar tendinopathy, _I still had my doubts!_\n\nI did months of unspecific rehab, but the pain was still there.\nI thought that there is no way that this injury could last this long when I was doing so much rehab. It's impossible!\n\nPeriodically I was convinced that I had some sort of bone injury, that's the only way the injury could still be bothering me.\n\nI did another MRI which found evidence of a bone lesion which looked harmless, but I was concerned that it was the cause of my problems.\n\nIt wasn't until I came home in September and saw 2 sports doctors that I was finally convinced that I had patellar tendinopathy.\n\nAt the end of the day **the most concerning thing throughout this whole process of diagnosis was that most doctors could not see anything wrong despite having access to detailed MRI images of my knee.**\nAnd this trend continues until today: I've had 5 radiologists and countless doctors tell me that everything looks healthy and normal, while I experience constant knee pain.\n\n# Treatments\n\n![Decline Squat](/images/posts/patellartendinopathy/declinesquat.jpg)\n\nWhen it comes to treating patellar tendinopathy, there are many different approaches.\nI want to categorize treatments based on their effectiveness in the scientific literature\nand add a little bit of my own commentary on what I've tried.\n\n### What Doesn't Work\n\nA lot of responses to patellar tendinopathy come from the false pretense that the pain is being causes by\ninflammation when in fact it is usually caused by degenerative tissue.\n\nMany doctors prescribe **anti-inflammatories\nor NSAIDs** which simply have no evidence supporting their effectiveness in treating patellar tendinopathy [[1]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00007256-200535010-00006#Sec15).\n\nSame goes for **corticosteroid injections** which are commonly prescribed to treat pain caused by patellar tendinopathy [[1]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00007256-200535010-00006#Sec15).\nThere isn't much evidence for the effectiveness of cortico steroids and it is commonly shown that injecting steroids into the tendon\ncauses weakening and increased chance of rupture.\n\nThe typical injury advice: **Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation (RICE)** also doesn't fully apply to patellar tendinopathy since it is not\nnecessarily an inflammatory condition. Rest may be necessary for a short period of time, but it is not a long term solution.\nIce can be used to mask the pain if too severe. Compression and elevation could be useful to provide blood flow to the tendon, but\nin reality the effectiveness is probably minimal.\n\nSpeaking of rest, **complete rest from activity seems counter productive** [[1]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00007256-200535010-00006#Sec15).\nInstead of eliminating activity, it can continue being done at a lower intensity. There were many periods where I personally took time off\nfrom running and those times were anecdotally the worst pain my knee has been in.\n\n### What Works\n\nThe modern consensus in scientific literature is that treatment for patellar tendinopathy should be focused on\n**tendon healing and strengthening** [[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5095939/#sec-5title).\nThis is consistent with the characterization of patellar tendinpathy as a degenerative disease that requires\nthe tendon to remodel itself to heal.\n\nNow what promotes tendon healing? Unfortunately not much.\nTendons take an extremely long time to heal because of the remodeling that occurs in the tendon is extremely slow and complex\n[[3]](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071811-150122?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed).\n\nIn fact, what promotes healing in the tendon seems to be the same thing that promotes strengthening: load.\nLoading is necessary for tendon development and regrowth [[4]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4418182/#S9title).\n\nThe complicated thing is that excess loading is what causes tendinopathy in the first place, so how do you load\nthe tendon to promote healing without causing more damage?\n\nFirst of all, a partial reduction in training is almost always necessary when pain symptoms worsen [[1, 2]](https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00007256-200535010-00006#Sec15). With running,\nthis can be done by decreasing the total mileage and intensity of the runs while spacing them out.\n\nWhen it comes to healing and strengthening, **eccentric quadricep exercises** are the staple exercise for treating patellar tendon pain [[2]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5095939/#sec-5title).\n\nIt is important to introduce these exercises gradually and without excessive pain. By gradually loading the tendon with slow, heavy, eccentric\nexercises the tendon is able to remodel itself without causing additional tendon degeneration.\n\nPopular exercises include: decline squat, step down, single leg squat, and knee extension.\n\n![Step Down](/images/posts/patellartendinopathy/stepdown.jpg)\n\n### What Mistakes I've Made\n\nLike with many injuries, it's easy to make mistakes during treatment. Here are some of the mistakes I've made:\n\n- **Not being consistent with rehabilitation** - this is the biggest issue that I have with injuries in general,\n  but it is especially important to be consistent with patellar rehab. I wasn't aggresive enough with\n  eccentric heavy loading, doing it for a few weeks and then moving onto more traditional weightlifting.\n\n- **Focusing too much on maintaining cardio** - after my injury developed, I quickly shifted focus on doing cross training like cycling\n  swimming. I wanted to maintain my fitness and I thought that the low impact would help me heal faster. In reality, I think I overdid\n  the cross training and prioritized it over rehabilitation.\n\n- **Neglecting running** - while doing a lot of cross training, I took a lot of time completely off from running or with large\n  breaks. I don't fully regret taking breaks from running, but I think that keeping a small amount of running consistently\n  throughout my training would have been more appropriate and I would remember how to run better.\n\n# Moving Forwards\n\nNow that I know how to handle patellar tendinopathy, here are the steps I'm taking to knock it out once and for all:\n\n- Avoid speedwork and focus on easy runs with some fast paces strides at the end of every run to remember how to run fast.\n- Really focus on the rehabilitation. I'm going to use single leg eccentric press,\n  single leg step down and quad extension while also including classic lifts like hexbar deadlift and backsquats.\n- More consistent rehab sessions. Minimum every other day doing one or more of the eccentric loading exercises with heavy weight.\n- Focus on prevention with specific strength training for the knee and using advice from the book [\"Running Rewired\" by Jay Dicharry](https://amzn.to/3gVXiNz).\n\n# References\n\nNo MLA format or anything but here are the links:\n\n- [[1] Patellar Tendinopathy in Athletes](https://link.springer.com/article/10.2165/00007256-200535010-00006)\n- [[2] CURRENT CONCEPTS IN THE TREATMENT OF PATELLAR TENDINOPATHY](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5095939)\n- [[3] Tendon Healing: Repair and Regeneration](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-bioeng-071811-150122?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed)\n- [[4] Mechanisms of tendon injury and repair](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4418182/#S9title)",

    "content": "It's been a second since I've wrote a blog post and I want to put down some of my thoughts since I've been transitioning back into running.\n\n# Total Training Volume\n\nIf we take a look at my volume in the last couple months when compared the the few months prior, there are a few things I noticed.\n\n![Chart of Total Training Volume](/images/posts/returntosport/volume.png)\n\nThere is **not a huge difference in overall training volume** between the two periods because of swimming, cycling and conditioning that I was doing.\n\nTaking a closer look, during the last few months my training volume **has been much more consistently hovering around or above 8-10 hours of training**, outside of tapering for important race weeks like Flying Pig 3/5/23 and West Point 4/2/23.\n\nThis consistency is thanks to me being more concrete about planning my training, as well as just being a result of feeling healthy enough to stick to my plans without bailing (as I often did when having issues with the knee).\n\nThere also has been a steady and healthy increase in the amount of running volume of the last couple months, including relatively consistent workouts, time trials and races which have helped contribute to my speed and motivation to keep up the training.\n\n# Running Volume\n\nIf we go week by week from February 12th which is when I really started to pick up the running again we can see the following trend in mileage.\n\n![Chart of Running Volume](/images/posts/returntosport/chart.png)\n\nDespite a few fluctuations due to races, the trend is upwards and the increase between weeks usually isn't too crazy (except from 13 to 14 which was experimental to say the least).\n\nPlanning out my training has helped decrease the amount of fluctuation and also allow for periodization (weeks with less running and some weeks with more running). And like I said earlier this has also helped with consistency.\n\nIf we look at the trendline, the cumulative increase has been at around 8% per week. A little high for my taste, but I think starting from around 20 miles, it's not too aggressive while also not being too conservative.\n\n## Threshold Workouts\n\nAnother key contributor to my triumphant return to running has been the use of high volume threshold training. I got interested in this after reading a lot about\nthe Norwegian Training Model, particularly focusing on the type of training that the top performing Norwegian and Kenyan athletes do which involved a significant amount\nof volume being performed at relatively low intensity for interval work.\n\n![Chart of Running Volume](/images/posts/returntosport/jakob.webp)\n\nAs shown in the above \"training week\" that Jakob Ingebristen does, a vast majority of the interval work is at 2.5mm to 3.5mm of lactate in the blood which for most people\nends up being a relatively slow pace, usually around what you could maintain for a half marathon distance. Since I don't have a lactate meter I've been estimating\nmy lactate threshold pace using primarily heart rate and rate of perceived exertion, but I've even been considering coughing up the money for a meter considering\nhow effective this training has been for me already and how much more effective it could be if I could more accurately target my lactate threshold.\n\nAnyways, since I've been slowly returning back to a higher amount of running I began introducing frequent threshold workouts as opposed to track workouts at a\nfaster pace, and I've been extremely impressed with the return on investment. I crushed my mile PR and 2-mile PR by a long shot, essentially a 40+ second improvement\nin my 2-mile time within 3 months of consistent training which is quite significant.\n\n## Cross Training\n\nThroughout the last couple months (and even throughout my injury) I've used cross training to maintain a high volume of aerobic intensity which also not building up the\nrunning volume too quickly which has helped me maintain a good level of fitness which has made it easier to balance the running training and also get much\nbetter returns on the threshold intensity work that I'm doing.\n\nQuantity and quality are both important in terms of becoming a better endurance athlete, but it's easy to get caught up in pursuing one but not the other.\nMaking my running sessions focused on quality threshold work and only some volume at a lower intensity has allowed me to really hone the quality of my\nrunning training while at the same time not increasing the volume too quickly.\n\nDoing a lot of lower intensity work on the bike and elliptical takes a lot of the stress away from the impact forces which cause a majority of the injuries in the\nfoot and lower leg. This has allowed me to maintain a high volume of aerobic intensity without having to worry about the impact forces that come with running, and\nthus I can take as much time as I need to build up the running volume and get the adaptations I need to maintain it.\n\n# Conclusions\n\nI've been extremely happy with my return to running and I'm excited to see what I'm able to do in the next couple of months when it comes to certain key\nraces and time trials leading up to the North American Orienteering Championships in Tahoe.\n\nMy focus is still on learning how to train better and smarter, I'm super excited that I've found a protocol that I really enjoy and that has worked\nwell for me so far although I'm still wary of injury because I know from experience it is always lurking around the next corner.\n\nSome upcoming smaller goals include running my first half marathon (this Sunday!). Trying to go under 16 minutes in the 5KM which I'll probably attempt right\naround my graduation in mid-June. Then, all the focus goes toward NAOC and orienteering training until those races, THEN I shift gears once again to Triathlon\ntraining to prepare for a half-Ironman distance in September which I'm really looking forward to. Glad to be back and I'll be sure to keep you all updated on\nwhatever comes next!",

    "content": "Hi everyone! To celebrate the launch of my new website and blog I wanted to make a post about smoothies!\n\n**What?**\n\nThat's right! Mostly because I just drank one and I wanted to share the recipe with the rest of the world.\n\nAnyways, let's jump straight into the recipe.\n\n## Recipe\n\nJust for your information, I don't really do exact amounts.\n\n- 1 banana (the bigger and riper the better)\n- a handful of frozen berries (I prefer blueberries and strawberries because they have less seeds)\n- around 1 cup of whole milk\n- 1 large egg\n- a tablespoon of honey (local is better)\n- 10-30 grams of protein powder (unflavored and minimally processed)\n\n![An image of the completed smoothie](/images/posts/smoothie/smoothie.jpg)\n\n## Health Benefits\n\nFirst I would like to say that I'm not a huge proponent of drinking smoothies all the time. Eating real food is usually better since it's good for your jaw (chewing) and it helps you eat and digest slower which is healthy.\n\nDespite that, ingredients like these have a number of health benefits and the convenience of making a smoothie from time to time cannot be overlooked.\n\nPretty much every ingredient in here is relatively dense in nutrients and are great performance boosters especially for athletes.\n\n### Bananas\n\nEveryone knows and loves bananas. Why? They are a [great source of vitamins](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/bananas/#:~:text=One%20serving%2C%20or%20one%20medium,fiber%2C%20and%20450%20mg%20potassium.) that are essential to performance.\n\n- Vitamin B6\n- Manganese\n- Vitamin C\n- Fiber\n- Biotin\n- Copper\n- Potassium\n\nBananas are touted to be the cure-all for muscle cramps, although that seems to be somewhat of a myth. Either way, it is a great source of simple carbohydrates and vitamins, but most importantly it gives the smoothie a great texture!\n\n### Frozen Berries\n\nI won't go into to much detail about this one as the benefits are very similar to that of bananas: a good source of simple carbs and fiber, plus they are dense in other vitamins and minerals. Plus if you get them frozen then they are cheaper and you don't have to add ice to the smoothie!\n\n### Whole Milk\n\nThe data on milk is always changing, but I personally believe that it is still a staple source of healthy fats, vitamins, minerals and protein. While the macros are great, the micronutrient content of milk is also quite impressive:\n\n- Phosphorus\n- Calcium\n- Vitamin A\n- Vitamin D (in products fortified with vitamin D)\n- Riboflavin\n- Vitamin B12\n- Potassium\n- Zinc\n- Choline\n- Magnesium\n- Selenium\n\nMany of these nutrients aren't even available in plant based foods like Selenium and Choline.\n\n> Selenium is an essential component of various enzymes and proteins, called selenoproteins, that help to make DNA and protect against cell damage and infections; these proteins are also involved in reproduction and the metabolism of thyroid hormones.\n>\n> <cite>\n>   [Harvard School of Public\n>   Health](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/selenium/#:~:text=Selenium%20is%20an%20essential%20component,the%20metabolism%20of%20thyroid%20hormones.)\n> </cite>\n\n### Eggs\n\nSpeaking of selenium, eggs have a larger amount of selenium than milk. In fact, in terms of nutrient density, eggs pretty much steal the show. They contain a small amount of all of these nutrients:\n\n- Vitamin A\n- Vitamin D\n- Vitamin E\n- Thiamin\n- Riboflavin\n- Vitamin B6\n- Vitamin B12\n- Folate\n\nAs well as Pantothenic Acid, Choline, Calcium, Iron, Magnesium, Phosphorus, Potassium, Sodium, Zinc, Copper, Manganese and Selenium.\n\nYup. Eggs, in my opinion, are probably the closest thing we have to a superfood. Plus, if you are worried about cholesterol, there is [no reason to be worried](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/C3A48F8C4614E65E0724F31C2997E7AE/S0029665113003844a.pdf/div-class-title-dietary-cholesterol-heart-disease-risk-and-cognitive-dissonance-div.pdf) (although please take health advice from your doctor).\n\n### Honey\n\nYet another amazing source of simple carbohydrates that is great before or after a tough session. I definetly recommend splurging for local, raw honey. Typically the darker and more viscous, the less processed the honey is so I would be on the lookout for those.\n\n### Protein Powder\n\nThere are many kinds of protein powder that I would never put into my smoothie. Since they qualify as supplements they are not regulated by the FDA and thus studies have found [unusually high levels of heavy metals and other unwanted chemicals and ingredients](https://cleanlabelproject.org/the-best-worst-protein-powder-products/) in many top label brands of protein powder.\n\nIf you're looking to get something cheap and high quality I recommend [bulksupplements.com](https://www.bulksupplements.com/collections/protein-powder) (and no I'm not sponsored) or if you want to opt-in for something a little more expensive then I recommend [collagen peptides by Vital Protein](https://amzn.to/3bCb1G9).\n\nHonestly, which powder you use depends on your preferences and honestly you don't even need to use any at all (although protein content of the smoothie will be quite low).",

    "content": "This past weekend I raced in my first triathlon ever. I wanted to do a triathlon since the summer of 2022 when I started to do more\ncross training because of my chronic patellar tendinopathy and I've always been interested in triathlon as a discipline so there really was\nno better time to try it out.\n\n# Training\n\nMy training, as usual, was not very organized. My focus is still on orienteering so much of my training focused on rehabilitating my running\nwhile maintaining decent cardiovascular shape. I found it decently hard to get myself to go swimming because I highly prefer biking as a form\nof cross training.\n\n### Sessions\n\nDuring my main training phase starting when I returned to Stanford in September 2022,\nI did around 6-10 hours of training per week which involved the following sessions:\n\n1. 3-5 sessions of running, not much speed work and mostly at a recovery pace\n2. 2-3 sessions of biking, usually 1 long session on the weekend of 2 hours and 1-2 shorter session on the stationary bike\n3. 1-2 sessions of swimming, usually 1-2km of freestyle but then I started doing more structured workouts with the swim club\n4. 1-3 session of strength training and PT - typically focusing on strengthening the muscles in the quad and loading the tendon to help recovery\n\n# Race\n\nI felt pretty good about my prerace preparations, despite confusing the actual date of the triathlon (I expected it to be a Saturday but it was actually on Sunday).\nSo I got a pretty decent taper in beforehand, 3 super easy sessions in the days leading up to the event.\n\n### Swim\n\nSo the swim was unfortunately cancelled due to poor weather conditions which is a bit sad since I wanted to experience the entirety of a triathlon,\nbut it was probably good for my overall performance since I was not very confident about my swimming abilities as it was my weakest discipline for sure.\n\nInstead we just had a longer run up to the bike, it was about 1.2 kilometers I completed in 3:42 and by then I was only 18 seconds behind the leader\nin the top 20. I took a decent amount of time in the transition, but I was still one of the first bikers out so I was pretty happy with that.\n\n### Bike\n\nThis section went quite poorly, I realized when running into the transition that I forgot to take my bike lock off the bike. It was only attached\nto the frame so I didn't have to take it off but it was still unbelievably annoying to have this lock rattling around on the frame and I had to\nconstantly adjust it so that it didn't hit my legs. I also started cramping about 3/4 of the way through but by the end it went away. I think I had\na pretty respectable time all things considered, lost about 4 minutes to the leader coming out around 40-50th place.\n\n### Run\n\nI never felt so weird during a run as the first mile of this 5K. My legs were so freaked out from transitioning from a hard bike ride into a hard run\nthat it felt like I was running at snail speed. After the first mile I warmed up and it felt okay, I still think that it felt like I was running faster\nthan I actually was because my final time was 19:08 which is a decent pace, but I felt like I was running a lot harder.\n\nLooking back at the paces, my first kilometer wasn't actually that slow it just felt bad because of coming off the bike, the pacing overall was\nsolid I think I just didn't expect to get so exhausted from the bike ride and previous run.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThat was super duper fun. I only raced on a bike once before and it was on Mount Diablo which was insanely fun but there were many more people around\nmy speed during this race so it was much more fun (although a bit scary going so fast). I think I'll definitely do more triathlons in the future,\nplanning on doing the half-ironman in Santa Cruz in September so hopefully I'll get a sprint triathlon in before then which actually has a swim.",

    "content": "It's that time of year again where we get to experience the highest level of orienteering, this time in the first ever sprint-only world champs! I did not get to participate this year, but I still wanted to go over some of the maps and results that came out of this championship.\n\nDespite being a forest orienteer, I found WOC this year to be quite entertaining. It seems that they increased the usage of artificial barriers which really made the courses quite challenging and we got to see some awesome unexpected results.\n\n![Tori Borish in the Relay](/images/posts/woc2022/relay.jpg)\n\n# Sprint Relay\n\nRelays are always a blast, and this year was no different. Right out of the gate there was a very interesting first control for the women. A forked leg with vastly different route choices depending on which control point they had.\nFor option B the clear option was to go south and for option A it seems that north or south were about the same if executed properly. Main takeaway here is that the southern option while similar distance seemed to be a bit speedier because there was so much straight running and not very many turns.\nMarika Teini seemed to do quite well out the start, but then again some competitors had to take option B which was not as good in the beginning here.\n\n![Route choices on a leg in the relay](/images/posts/woc2022/routechoice2.jpeg)\n\nAfter that there weren't any super interesting legs until after the arena passage where there was still a small group together in the lead. There were two main routes to number 10 and what was quite suprising is that despite the fact that both options were so close together,\nthe best route choice for each option was still different! This is great course planning. North was slightly better for option A and south for option B.\n\nThere was also a middle route to option A although it seems that Basset lost a little bit of time, but no hard feeling because\nif you take a look at the top route it is actually quite difficult to spot since the runners had to do a sharp U-turn and even then it's not clear that there is a good path to the control unless you look at it carefully while running the arena passage (which I'm sure many of them did).\n\n![Route choices on a leg in the relay](/images/posts/woc2022/routechoice1.jpeg)\n\nAt this point Lina Strand (Sweden), Simona Aebersold (Switzerland) and Charlotte Ward (Great Britain) took a small lead which I assume just came from high speed on the way to the tenth control.\nThis continued all the way until the end of the first leg where Lina Strand ran away from Simona on the last few controls.\n\nMax Petr Bejmer started for Sweden with a small lead and managed to keep it up pretty well. Hadorn had the worse forking on the first control and made some mistakes which didn't help and MPB was a full control ahead by number 4. They had the same leg after the arena passage\nand MPB took another great route to the south and maintained his lead while the rest were trying to catch up. The rest of the runners gained some time from pure speed on 11 and 12\n\n![Route choices on a leg in the relay](/images/posts/woc2022/routechoice3.jpeg)\n\nThen came the most decisive part of the whole relay. The Swiss, Norwegian, Czech and Finnish team ran down a path that was out of bounds. Personally I think its a load of crap that the runners even had the option to run in the out of bounds there as I assume\nthat there was no fence or tape that should block off a path like that. Either way, the runner ended up getting really far behind and even though they came out the same direction (thus were not disqualified) it really gave Sweden and Great Britain a huge lead.\n\nIn the third leg we got to see Kristian Jones start right after Gustav Bergman, two very strong runners who didn't struggle to maintain the lead they gained on the rest of the field. Although shoutout to Kasper Fosser and Mattias Kyburz who had the fastest time on the third leg.\n\n![Gustav Bergman in the relay](/images/posts/woc2022/gustav.jpg)\n\nThe last leg was a little more interesting. Tove Alexandersson was chasing right behind Megan Carter Davies, two of the best sprint runners in the scene right now. Although Tove didn't struggle to chase down and overtake Megan Carter Davies on\nsome of the early route choice legs, but Megan Carter Davies did a great job holding on and didn't allow the runners behind to gain much time. In the chasing pack, we saw an impressive performance by Andrine Benjaminsen of Norway who gained 3 places and was\nthe second fastest runner on her leg putting Norway into 3rd place behind Sweden and Great Britain. Elena Roos has a great run too, only 8 seconds slower than Benjaminsen.\n\nOverall a great race that maybe would've been more interesting if some of the runners didn't make that ridiculous mistake in the out of bounds, but either way Sweden looked very dominant throughout the race and definitely deserved the victory.\n\n# Knockout Sprint\n\nThe first of its kind! This was probably my favorite one to watch (although I only watched the finals and semi finals). Karolin Ohlsson had a poor race and didn't qualify to the semi finals which was a surprise.\n\n### Men's Semi-Finals\n\n![Kris Jones in the knockout sprint semi-final](/images/posts/woc2022/jones.jpg)\n\nThe first semi-final was amazing to watch and I highly recommend checking out the TV footage. Kristian Jones led a majority of the race and looked calm and in control taking the win. Mattias Kyburz followed not far behind and towards the end of the race he\nmade a very interesting move where it looked like he intentionally baited some of the other runners to go into a passageway when in reality he quickly backed out.\n\n![Finish of the second mens knockout sprint semi-final](/images/posts/woc2022/finish.jpg)\n\nThe second knockout sprint was also very exciting and probably had one of the closest sprint finishes. After reaching the 2nd to last control, the Norwegian runner Eidsmo quickly picked up the pace and forced everyone to remain hot on his heels.\nUnfortunately, at the last control he made a TINY mistake that cost him a spot in the final! Definitely the best finish.\n\n![Tim Robertson in the third knockout sprint semi-final](/images/posts/woc2022/tim.jpg)\n\nThe third knockout sprint was also interesting, although maybe the least impressive of the three semifinals.\nTim Robertson and Aston Key led the beginning of the race, however the young Australian fell behind and made a poor route choice to the last control while August Mollen pulled head of Robertson and the two of them came through to the next round.\n\n![Tove Alexandersson in the knockout sprint semi-final](/images/posts/woc2022/tove.jpg)\n\n### Women's Semi-Finals\n\nIn the first women's semifinal, Tove swept the field with Simona Aebersold following not far behind. Tove had good control over the entire race and as usual she had higher speed than the rest of the field. Unfortunately, Tereza Janosikova didn't qualify.\n\nThe second womens final was much more interesting with many strong runners, Megan Carter Davies, Andrine Benjaminsen, Venla Harju and Eef van Dongen, just to name a few. Megan Carter Davies took control from the beginning all the way to the end where she took the lead. And on the route choice to the last control, Eef van Dongen took the better route and made it into the final with a 2nd place finish!\n\nIn the last final, we had the Ukrainian Kateryna Dzema start out strong to the second control, then the field split where she lost some time to the other runners.\n\n### Men's Finals\n\nWow! This was an amazing final. So many great runners and it was really great to see Tim Robertson and some other take many risky and interesting route choice. Spoiler alert: Mattias Kyburz won with an amazing last leg! His strategy seems dominant in this kind of race,\nhanging back and reading ahead until the end where he pulls away with his great speed.\n\n### Women's Finals\n\nNot as interesting as the Men's final since Tove swept once again, however Megan Carter Davies definitely gave her a run for her money. The most amazing result was from Eef van Dongen who took home a BRONZE MEDAL! After 4 years of orienteering, how amazing!\n\n# Sprint Final\n\n![Kasper Fosser](/images/posts/woc2022/kasper5.jpg)\n![Kasper Fosser](/images/posts/woc2022/kasper1.jpg)\n![Kasper Fosser](/images/posts/woc2022/kasper2.jpg)\n![Kasper Fosser](/images/posts/woc2022/kasper3.jpg)\n![Kasper Fosser](/images/posts/woc2022/kasper4.jpg)\n\nand Tove got beat by Megan Carter Davies.
